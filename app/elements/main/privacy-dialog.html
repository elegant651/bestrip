Travel Destinations
When you book international travel reservations with third-party suppliers or plan
international trips using this Website, you are responsible for ensuring that you
meet all foreign entry requirements and that your travel documents, including
passports and visas, are in order.
For passport and visa requirements, please consult the relevant embassy or
consulate for information. Because requirements may change at any time, be sure
to check for up-to-date information before booking and departure. FLAMINGO
accepts no liability for travelers who are refused entry onto a flight or into any
country because of the traveler’s failure to carry the travel documents required by
any airline, authority, or country, including countries the traveler may just be
passing through en route to his or her destination.
It is also your responsibility to consult your physician for current
recommendations on inoculations before you travel internationally, and to ensure
that you meet all health entry requirements and follow all medical guidance related
to your trip.
Although most travel, including travel to international destinations, is completed
without incident, travel to certain destinations may involve greater risk than
others. FLAMINGO urges passengers to investigate and review travel prohibitions,
warnings, announcements and advisories issued by the United States Government,
any other Government and destination country governments prior to booking travel
to international destinations. Information on conditions in various countries and
the level of risk associated with travel to particular international destinations can
be found on webpages such as www.state.gov, http://www.auswaertiges-amt.de,
www.eda.admin.ch.
By listing information relevant to travel to particular international destinations,
FLAMINGO does not represent or warrant that travel to such points is advisable or
without risk, and is not liable for damages or losses that may result from travel to
such destinations.
